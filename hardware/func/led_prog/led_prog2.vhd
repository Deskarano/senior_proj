-- Definition of a program memory for KCPSM6 including generic parameters for the 
-- convenient selection of device family, program memory size and the ability to include 
-- the JTAG Loader hardware for rapid software development.
--
-- This file is primarily for use during code development and it is recommended that the 
-- appropriate simplified program memory definition be used in a final production design.

--                             "7S"               7-Series device 
--                                                  (Artix-7, Kintex-7, Virtex-7 or Zynq)
--
--    C_RAM_SIZE_KWORDS        1, 2 or 4          Size of program memory in K-instructions
--
--    C_JTAG_LOADER_ENABLE     0 or 1             Set to '1' to include JTAG Loader
--
-- Notes
--
-- If your design contains MULTIPLE KCPSM6 instances then only one should have the 
-- JTAG Loader enabled at a time (i.e. make sure that C_JTAG_LOADER_ENABLE is only set to 
-- '1' on one instance of the program memory). Advanced users may be interested to know 
-- that it is possible to connect JTAG Loader to multiple memories and then to use the 
-- JTAG Loader utility to specify which memory contents are to be modified. However, 
-- this scheme does require some effort to set up and the additional connectivity of the 
-- multiple BRAMs can impact the placement, routing and performance of the complete 
-- design. Please contact the author at Xilinx for more detailed information. 
--
-- Regardless of the size of program memory specified by C_RAM_SIZE_KWORDS, the complete 
-- 12-bit address bus is connected to KCPSM6. This enables the generic to be modified 
-- without requiring changes to the fundamental hardware definition. However, when the 
-- program memory is 1K then only the lower 10-bits of the address are actually used and 
-- the valid address range is 000 to 3FF hex. Likewise, for a 2K program only the lower 
-- 11-bits of the address are actually used and the valid address range is 000 to 7FF hex.
--
-- Programs are stored in Block Memory (BRAM) and the number of BRAM used depends on the 
-- size of the program and the device family. 
--
-- In a Spartan-6 device a BRAM is capable of holding 1K instructions. Hence a 2K program 
-- will require 2 BRAMs to be used and a 4K program will require 4 BRAMs to be used. It 
-- should be noted that a 4K program is not such a natural fit in a Spartan-6 device and 
-- the implementation also requires a small amount of logic resulting in slightly lower 
-- performance. A Spartan-6 BRAM can also be split into two 9k-bit memories suggesting 
-- that a program containing up to 512 instructions could be implemented. However, there 
-- is a silicon errata which makes this unsuitable and therefore it is not supported by 
-- this file.
--
-- In a Virtex-6 or any 7-Series device a BRAM is capable of holding 2K instructions so 
-- obviously a 2K program requires only a single BRAM. Each BRAM can also be divided into 
-- 2 smaller memories supporting programs of 1K in half of a 36k-bit BRAM (generally 
-- reported as being an 18k-bit BRAM). For a program of 4K instructions, 2 BRAMs are used.
